This repository is oriented to perform the simulation of the
EDScorbot with Matlab and Simulink.

To perform the simulation, follow the steps below:

1.      Load files in Matlab:

a. Accessing to Matlab live with the following link
link: When entering the link Matlab suggests to save the repository as 
/MATLAB Drive/Repositories/ED-Scorbot. Save it that way.
Inside the ED-Scorbot repository, go to the path: /Simulator-Simulink/Simulation.  
Here are all the files needed to run the simulations.


b. Through Matlab installed on the computer. 
Download the file folders STL-files and Simulation.
STL-files: contains the parts of the EDScorbot in STL format.
Simulation: contains the files of Matlab and Simulink files. 

Once downloaded, it is necessary to modify the following Simulink files:

-  EDScorbot_Arm: inside this file you have to modify the following elements
the elements: base, body, upper_arm, forearm, flange, gripper_base_link, gripper_finger_right
and gripper_finger_left. Once inside the element, the ‘visual’ block must be searched for.
visual’ block where you must put the path of its respective STL file.
This should be done for each element. 

-  EDScorbot_IJC_2DOF_PID: inside the block called Scorbot, to which you must put the
block called Scorbot, to which the path of the STL files corresponding to the elements of the robot must be modified.
STL files corresponding to the elements of the robot, as it was done in EDScorbot_Arm.

-   EDCorbot_CTC_Control: carry out the same procedure as for the aforementioned file.
procedure of the above mentioned file. Once this procedure is done the simulations can be performed.


2. Perform simulation:

Step 1: execute the file ‘Load_Robot_and_Points’.
this file will load the robot in the workspace as well as the trajectories to be performed.
trajectories to be performed.

Step 2: open the file
file corresponding to the controller this could be: EDScorbot_IJC_2DOF_PID or EDCorbot_CTC_Control,
Once inside the selected file, change the value of the ‘Set’ block to 1 or 0.
or 0, this will allow you to activate one of the two trajectory generators. 1:
To generate a square trajectory or 0: to generate a lemniscate type trajectory.

3. Result graphs:
Once the simulation of the Simulink file has been carried out, we proceed to go to the Matlab environment 
where we will execute the file corresponding to the simulation carried out with one of the two types of control. 
These files will be: IJC_Graphics or CTC_Graphics. If the Simulink simulation was done with the ‘EDScorbot_IJC_2DOF’ file, 
the ‘IJC_Graphics’ file must be executed. On the other hand, if the simulation was done with ‘EDCorbot_CTC_Control’, 
the CTC_Graphics file must be run.
These two Matlab files will allow us to obtain: the trajectories generated by the robot with respect to the reference trajectory; 
the deviations of the x, y and z components in time, with respect to the reference Cartesian coordinates; 
an error graph between the points of the reference trajectory and the one generated by the robot; and finally the RMSE.
